## How to contribute

Thanks for showing interest in contributing to our project.
This project started out as a hobby project but over the years it has grown to a more serious application.
If you would wish to contribute to this project feel free to contact us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/fhmKBM7) or via an [Discussion](https://github.com/HarmlessKey/Shieldmaiden/discussions) on GitHub.
We will give you access to our contributors guide.

### Requirements
To get started with development you will need:
- Node 16. We recommend using `nvm` or something similar to manage your node versions.
- A personal firebase project
- DB init JSON found in our contributors guide.

### Installation
If you've followed our contributors guide, you can simply run:

```
npm i
```

followed by 

```
npm run ssr
```

To start the dev env.

**IT'S EASY!! :rocket:**

## Bug reports / Feature requests
There are two main ways to submit bug reports or request new features: **[Discord](https://discord.gg/fhmKBM7)** or **[Github](https://github.com/HarmlessKey/Shieldmaiden/issues)**.

Discord is our main communication channel with our community.

We're in the process of moving our Azure DevOps board over to Github, but we want to use Github to keep track of upcoming features.

## Pull Requests
This is something we will have to figure out in collaboration with you, as there haven't been any external collaborators thus far!
