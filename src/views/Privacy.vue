		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h3>First, thank you for using the Harmless Key Encounter Tracker!</h3>
		<p>This policy is to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have.</p>

		<h3>How We Collect Your Information</h3>
		<p>When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</p>
		<p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, the email address or phone number you used to sign up, details about your campaigns and any other information you provide us.</p>

		<p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Google account to Harmless Key, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts. The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>

		<p>We also get technical information when you use our products</p>

		<p>These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>

		<p>Log data. When you use Harmless Key, our servers may automatically record information ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you're using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web pages you visited that had Harmless Key features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Harmless Key, and cookie data.</p>
		
		<p>Cookie data. Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Harmless Key account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Harmless Key settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Harmless Key. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Harmless Key account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.</p>
		
		<p>Device information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Harmless Key on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
		
		<h3>Transferring your Information</h3>
		
		<p>Harmless Key is headquartered in the Netherlands. By using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information inside the Netherlands, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those in your home country.</p>
		
		<h3>How and when do we share information</h3>
		
		<p>Anyone that has the link, can follow your encounters. Other than that none of your information is shared with anyone.</p>
		
		<h3>What choices do you have about your information?</h3>
		<p>You may close your account at any time, you can delete it under "you profile". All your data will be removed from our database.</p>
				
		<p>Our policy on children's information</p>
		
		<p>Harmless Key is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us.</p>
		
		<p>How do we make changes to this policy?</p>
		
		<p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we'll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Harmless Key after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or get your consent as required by law.</p>
