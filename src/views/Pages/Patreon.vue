						<h2>Character Sync</h2>
						<p>
							You will be able to sync your players characters with external online character sheets
							from D&D Beyond and Dice Cloud using the
							<a
								:href="`https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dd-character-sync/${extension_id}`"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener"
								>Character Sync Chrome Extension</a
							>. This way you won't have manually update your players, but you can simply click a
							button.<br />
							<router-link to="/tools/character-sync">More about Character Sync</router-link>
						</p>
						<h2>Avatar crop & upload</h2>
						<p>
							For both players and NPCs you can upload an image and crop it to your liking. Without
							a subscription you have to reference an online image to use as an avatar.
						</p>
						<h2>Background effects</h2>
						<p>
							With our background effect you can create more atmosphere on the public initiative
							list that you share with your players. With effects like rain and fog your players
							will be immersed in your games even more than before.<br />
							<router-link to="/weather-demo">Check out all background effects</router-link>
						</p>
						<h2>Import content</h2>
						<p>
							You can import any Shieldmaiden content directly into your account. If a friend or a
							content creator you follow has offered an export of an export of a Campaign from
							Shieldmaiden, you can import it including all the monsters, spells and encounters and
							you will be able to directly run it yourself.

				<hk-card header="Why do you have to pay?">
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>
							We wish we could offer the app for free. This is why we do have a free tier that
							should be sufficient for most users. All the essential features will always be
							accessible for all users, without cost. You only pay for more storage and quality of
							life features.<br />
							Unfortunately creating an app brings some costs with it. We need to invest a lot of
							time in maintaining and expanding the app. And there are the costs of hosting
							Shieldmaiden, as our user base expands, the costs increase.
						</p>

						<h2>Building together</h2>
						<p>
							Our goal is not to earn money, our goal is to create a D&D initiative tracker that is
							useful for the entire community. <br />
							To reach this goal, we will need support. This is why we have set up a Patreon. This
							way you can help us in achieving this goal and benefit from the extra's that come with
							it.
